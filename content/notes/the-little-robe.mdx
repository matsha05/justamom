Hey friend,

It's the end of November and it still hasn't snowed yet in Colorado. In fact, not only has it not snowed, but my kids are running around outside in shorts and t-shirts like it's a balmy July afternoon. This time of year is usually marked by the frantic hunt for long-lost mittens, hats, and snow pants, hoping at least a couple of them fit my weed children.

**Fun fact:** Emma wore 18-month snow pants until she was four. I finally caved and bought her new ones when there was a sizable gap between the end of the boots and the beginning of the pants. Can anyone relate? Maybe your four-year-old isn't wearing size 18-month gear, but these kids… they just keep growing.

All of this outgrowing reminded me of a woman named Hannah in the Bible who longed for a child (1 Samuel 1–2). God answered her prayer, and after she weaned her son, Samuel, she dedicated him to the Lord. Each year, she would travel to visit him and bring a fresh little robe she had made with her own hands (1 Samuel 2:19).

I love that God included that detail. A mother who couldn't stop loving, sewing, remembering. A child who kept growing. A small act of faithfulness woven into her worship and her gratitude.

So as you scramble to find hats or rush to buy bigger snow pants on that first snowy morning, maybe you'll remember Hannah. And maybe you'll remember this too:

> God sees the quiet care you give.
> He sees the small, steady work.
> And it matters.
